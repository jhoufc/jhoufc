### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Fullstack developer with more 10 yars, work with .NET / C# .

I recently started to study new technologies related to the development of APPs.
NodeJS
React / React-Native (NextJS)
Mongo / Express

I was fascinated with the possibilities that these languages provide, and as I have been working with JavaScript Vanilla and JQuery for many years, I am quickly learning to implement this type of application, I hope to build apps that can help people in their daily lives and make difference in their lives.


see you later
